# Job Search Website

This is a simple **React App** that displays Job Posts in 2 view **(List and Map)**.

It uses a simple backend service [rss-server](https://github.com/MohammadNaqaweh/rss-server.git) that fetches the jobs from an RSS Feed and passes it to the frontend service where it is minupluated and displayed in the 2 views accordingly.

The backend service is written in javascript (node.js framework) and uses express and cors to setup the routes for the APIs.

The frontend is written in React and uses react-bootstrap package for styled components, axios for the API calls, and google-maps-react.

---

### Backend Service provides 2 APIs: 

1. `getJobPosts`
    
    Returns an **Array of Objects** after parsing the RSS Feed. The returned Objects look like:
```
{
  "title": "Title of the Job Post",
  "country": "Country of the Job Post",
  "posted_date": "The date the job was posted"
  "description": "An HTML String",
  "link": "link to the job post"
}
```

2. `getCoordinates`

    Takes query parameter of `country name` and returns and object that look like:

```
{
  "lat": "The latitude",
  "lng": "The longitude",
  "country": "The country name"
}
```

### The website use google maps Api via a npm package called [google-maps-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-maps-react)

### The website use react-bootstrap components for rendering coustome components

# Running the Website

### To run the website first we need to run the backend services to do that

1. `mkdir rssParser`
2. clone the Repo: `git clone https://github.com/MohammadNaqaweh/rss-server.git`
3. `cd rss-server`
4. `yarn install` to install all dependancies in the project
5. `npm start` to start the localhost of the backend service 
6. ensure that the server is running correctly by seeing `App is active` in the rss-server terminal.

After this we can strat the React website:

1. in anpther terminal go to `rssParser` directory  
2. clone the react app Repo: `git clone https://github.com/MohammadNaqaweh/rss.git`
3. `cd rss`
4. `yarn install` to install all dependancies in the project
5. `npm start` to start the webpage
6. go to `http://localhost:3000/`
